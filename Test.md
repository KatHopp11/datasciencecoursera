### This is a test how this all works
## Hopefully it works
* after saving this file in the directory I will...
* git add .
* git commit -m "this is a new test file"
* git push origin master

## General things
* git status
* gitk, shows what has been changed more visual
* git log

## File will be updated with more stuff later
